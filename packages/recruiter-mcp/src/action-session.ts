/**
 * The bridge between the two session types — Phase 2c Slice 0b.
 *
 * The recruiter server authenticates an `AuthenticatedSession`; the action service requires an
 * `ActionSession` whose token id matches `/^action:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,120}$/` (`action-mcp/src/crypto.ts`).
 * A recruiter token id does not match, which is why action tools could not be registered at all.
 *
 * The shape is ATTENUATION, not fresh issuance. The recruiter's signed session is already a
 * capability; the precedented move is to derive a narrower one from it rather than mint an unrelated
 * peer. Three properties carry that:
 *
 *   1. **The derived id is a pure function of the parent id.** Same recruiter session always yields
 *      the same action session, so an intent minted under it stays verifiable across process
 *      restarts and instances without storing anything.
 *   2. **The parent id is not recoverable from it.** It is an HMAC under the scope signing secret,
 *      so the derived id can appear in a ledger row without leaking the session token's identity.
 *   3. **`TOKEN_ID_PATTERN` is satisfied, never relaxed.** Weakening that pattern to make the types
 *      line up would trade a real control — it is what stops cross-session intent replay
 *      (`action-mcp/src/service.ts` `assertIntentSession`) — for a type convenience.
 *
 * The fail-closed rule below denies rather than degrades, and it is about binding rather than
 * caution: a session we cannot bind to a stable id is one whose write authority we could not revoke
 * afterwards, and an unrevocable write session is the thing the derivation exists to prevent. The
 * client claim works differently since 2026-08-06 (Sam's call, CLO-103): a legacy token names no
 * client, but its SURFACE is signed, so the bridge infers the client from the surface and says so —
 * `clientAttribution` marks the session as inferred, never as self-named.
