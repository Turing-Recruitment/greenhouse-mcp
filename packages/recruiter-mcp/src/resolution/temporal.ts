/**
 * Temporal-now view (Axis 1, the no-fork slice). Recruiters keep asking week-over-week pipeline
 * questions ("is inflow up or down this week?") that a point-in-time snapshot cannot answer. Application
 * `created_at` IS a real, spread timestamp, so weekly inflow, a genuine two-window WoW diff, a weekly
 * status-mix trend, and inflow velocity are all computable — in memory, over the application set the
 * recipe already read (the analysis window spans many weeks; no second read).
 *
 * HONESTY FLOOR: this view is built ONLY from `created_at`. True stage-flow-over-time (how candidates
 * moved stage-to-stage each week) needs application_stages `entered_at`, which is null/backfilled on
 * this Greenhouse instance (live-pilot finding L3) — so it is NOT reconstructable and is disclosed as
 * unavailable, never manufactured as zero (mirroring stage_conversion_rate's notImplemented metric).
 *
 * WoW correctness: the diff compares the two most recent COMPLETE CALENDAR weeks (last full week vs the
 * week before it), reading 0 for a week with no inflow. It never folds in the in-progress (partial)
 * week — comparing a partial week against a full one would understate the current week — so the partial
 * week is reported separately. Calendar-adjacent (not "two most recent weeks that happened to have
 * data") so a quiet week reads as a real 0, never as a skipped comparison against a non-adjacent week.
 *
 * WINDOWED MODE: a caller that states an analysis window passes it here, and the view is then anchored
 * to `window_end` rather than to now, bounded to `window_start`, and horizoned by the window's own span
 * instead of a fixed 12 weeks. That is what makes a historical question answerable at all — anchored to
 * now, a six-month-old window produced an EMPTY weekly series, because every bucket fell outside the
 * 12-week horizon before now. The 0-for-a-missing-week reading survives only INSIDE the window: a
 * comparison week that is not wholly inside it is reported as null-with-a-reason, never as a real 0,
 * because "no rows read for that week" and "that week was never in scope" are different facts.
