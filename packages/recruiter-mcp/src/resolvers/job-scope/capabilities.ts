/**
 * The capability catalogue for the recruiter MCP: the approved scoped analysis recipes, the user
 * modes, and the scope-resolution contract.
 *
 * It used to say "read-only" unconditionally and list "No write/admin tools" under `excluded`. That
 * became false the day the write plane shipped: an entitled session's catalog carries 22 preview and
 * apply tools, and this document told the model they did not exist. The catalogue is now told which
 * write actions THIS session actually holds, and says so.
 *
 * Two things stay withheld, on Sam's 2026-09-02 rulings, and neither is a hedge:
 *   1. Teammate (colleague) email addresses on /v3/users, for job-scoped line recruiters. Site admins
 *      and allowlisted operators DO receive them — they administer the staff directory — which is the
 *      org's own Greenhouse permission boundary, not a caution of ours.
 *   2. Private note bodies, scorecard private_notes, and custom-field VALUES flagged private in
 *      Greenhouse, for everyone on this surface. These are gated by Greenhouse's own "see private
 *      notes" / "View Private" permissions; granting them here would be a side-door around the system
 *      of record.
 * Everything else this file once called unavailable is available, and now says so.
