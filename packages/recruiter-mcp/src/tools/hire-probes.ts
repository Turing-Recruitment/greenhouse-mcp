/**
 * The three live probes that ride along with H0.
 *
 * None of them is a new binary. They follow the shape `scripts/live-probe.mjs` already establishes
 * — OAuth2 client-credentials token exchange against `https://auth.greenhouse.io/token`, then a
 * bearer GET against `https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v3` — so an operator can run each as a
 * one-liner and record the answer on CLO-269. Every one is a GET; nothing mutates.
 *
 * Get a token once (never echo it; `$TOKEN` stays in the shell):
 *
 *   TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://auth.greenhouse.io/token \
 *     -d grant_type=client_credentials -d client_id="$GREENHOUSE_CLIENT_ID" \
 *     -d client_secret="$GREENHOUSE_CLIENT_SECRET" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])')
 *
 * (a) OFFER COMPENSATION PRIVACY — decides whether PO10 (offer against the posted band) can exist
 *     on the recruiter surface at all. Prints the offer custom-field DEFINITIONS, which carry no
 *     candidate data, so the body is safe to read:
 *
 *   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
 *     'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v3/custom_fields?field_type=offer&active=true&per_page=200' \
 *     | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.dumps([{k:f.get(k) for k in ("id","name","name_key","value_type","private")} for f in json.load(sys.stdin)],indent=1))'
 *
 *     Feed that array to `classifyOfferCompensationPrivacy` below for the verdict.
 *
 * (b) EEOC SCOPE — decides whether the deferred demographic mode is possible at all. BEHAVIOURAL,
 *     not a token inspection: the token's shape is unknown and decoding it would materialize a
 *     secret. Record the STATUS CODE only; `/v3/eeoc` returns row-level demographic responses tied
 *     to a candidate, the most sensitive body in the API, and it must never be printed:
 *
 *   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
 *     'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v3/eeoc?per_page=1'
 *
 * (c) USER_JOB_PERMISSIONS READABILITY — unblocks R2d's first binding ("who else can see this
 *     req"). Status code only, same discipline:
 *
 *   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
 *     'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v3/user_job_permissions?per_page=1'
 *
 * For (b) and (c): 200 means the credential holds the scope, 401/403 means it does not, and
 * anything else is inconclusive and should be recorded verbatim as the code it returned.

 * else is `inconclusive`, which is also an answer — it says "do not plan PO10 on this yet", and it
 * covers the three ways this read can fail to settle the question:
 *
 *   - nothing on the offer surface looks like compensation (the field may be named something this
 *     pattern does not know, or the tenant may hold pay outside Greenhouse);
 *   - the matching fields DISAGREE, so "is comp private" has no single answer;
 *   - a matching definition carries no `private` flag at all, so the read never learned it.
 *
 * Guessing either way here would be the fabrication the whole build forbids: a false `available`
 * plans a recipe that returns nothing, and a false `withheld` withholds a capability for a
 * constraint nobody demonstrated.
