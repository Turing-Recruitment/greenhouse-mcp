 *
 * Native filtering stays the FIRST attempt — it is cheap wherever the endpoint really supports it,
 * and this must never become "always read everything". A 422 with THIS CALL'S OWN range params in
 * play re-reads without them and applies the window locally to the complete scoped set, and the
 * caller is handed everything it needs to say so out loud.
 *
 * Two things the fallback deliberately does NOT do, because both turn a self-heal into silent data
 * loss (Codex review of 61e48ad):
 *
 *  - It does not treat every 422 as a date 422. Only the bracket keys these `windowSpecs` produced
 *    are stripped, and when the request carries none of them the error is rethrown: a 422 about a
 *    malformed `job_ids` would otherwise be "healed" into a full unfiltered read of the tenant.
 *  - It does not strip range params it did not add. A caller filtering `salary[gte]` alongside a
 *    date window keeps that filter on the re-read.
 *
 * Lifted out of `runEvidenceListRead`, where it was the only copy and unreachable from the recipes
 * and the planner (`read-all.ts` rethrows a non-timeout error), so the hire path and the planner's
 * offer read get the same two legs rather than a hard failure on the endpoint that needs it most.
