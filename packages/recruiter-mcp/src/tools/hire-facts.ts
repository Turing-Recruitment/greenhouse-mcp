 *
 * Three facts about the live API decide the shape:
 *
 *  1. The LIVE `/v3/offers` endpoint 422s every date filter the vendored contract advertises, so
 *     the `resolved_at` range goes through `readAllWithDateFallback` — native filter first, local
 *     window and a disclosure second. Never a denial.
 *  2. The default org-wide scope carries NO `job_ids` (analysis-context.ts), so a permission-wide
 *     hire read is ONE permission-bounded read. Chunking is for a FROZEN explicit job set only;
 *     chunking a permission-wide read would turn one call into one per permitted req for nothing.
 *  3. On the privacy-only branches every offer batch also walks `application_id` and
 *     `candidate_id` upstream, so each optional bridge here is a real cost and is opt-in.
