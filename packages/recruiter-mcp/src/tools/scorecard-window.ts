/**
 * The scorecard recipes' window, read the same way it is reported.
 *
 * Both scorecard recipes analyse a card on its INTERVIEW date, falling back to its SUBMISSION date
 * when no interview date was recorded — but both used to ask Greenhouse for `created_at >= window_start`
 * instead. Those are different clocks: a card created before the window but interviewed inside it was
 * dropped upstream and never counted, while a card created inside the window but interviewed long
 * before it was read and then thrown away in memory. /v3/scorecards accepts `interviewed_at` and
 * `submitted_at` as server-side range filters (harvest-v3-registry.generated.ts, /v3/scorecards), so
 * the recipe now selects on the basis it reports.
 *
 * Two reads, unioned: one bounded on `interviewed_at`, one on `submitted_at`. The second read is what
 * catches a card carrying only a submission date; the union is deduped so a card matching both filters
 * is counted once. The in-memory `scorecardWindowBasis` check stays authoritative over both.
 *
 * Range encoding: BOTH of Harvest v3's date-filter forms are honoured, and neither is a legacy
 * accident. The pipe form (`created_at=gte|2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`) is the syntax the vendored guide
 * documents (`docs/harvest-v3-api/guides/0002-list-endpoints.md:36,41`); `analyze_rejection_reason_drift`
 * still sends it and it reaches Greenhouse intact. The bracket form (`interviewed_at[gte]=...`) is the
 * one `evidence-read.ts` translates the model-facing date shorthands into, the one `sanitizeReadParams`
 * admits by matching a bracket key against its BASE param name (limits.ts), and the one live-verified
 * against the tenant in July — so it is what these reads use. Neither form is rewritten anywhere
 * between here and the client's `URLSearchParams` serialization (control-plane/client-readonly.ts).
 *
 * That matters for what the OLD code was doing: `created_at=gte|<window_start>` was a real, honoured
 * server-side floor. It was not inert. It genuinely dropped every card created before the window,
 * including the ones interviewed inside it — which is exactly the bug this module exists to fix.
