/**
 * The ORDER the registrar emits the read catalog in — not a filter.
 *
 * ALL REGISTERED RECRUITER READ TOOLS ARE EXPOSED. A tool is removed from a running server only by
 * `GREENHOUSE_RECRUITER_DISABLE_TOOLS` (the denylist), which forces whoever removes it to name it and
 * to state a reason. There is no allowlist: `GREENHOUSE_RECRUITER_ALLOWED_TOOLS` was deleted in R2a
 * because it was the mechanism — a hand-maintained env list stating a count and no reason — that hid
 * 22 built, tested readers, and because it FAILED OPEN when unset, so it was never a control either.
 *
 * This list therefore has one job: put the analytical front doors and the tools a recruiter reaches
 * for first at the top of a client's tool picker, and the reference dictionaries last. It must name
 * every entry in `RECRUITER_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` and nothing else; `test/catalog-registrar.test.ts`
 * asserts that property in both directions, so adding a reader without ordering it fails the suite
 * rather than silently hiding it.
 *
 * It lives in its own leaf module so `resolvers/job-scope/capabilities` can tell the model which
 * tools it holds without importing the registrar that imports the job-scope tools.
