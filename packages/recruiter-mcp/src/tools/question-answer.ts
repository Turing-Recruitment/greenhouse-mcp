    'THE FRONT DOOR for aggregate analytical questions — metrics, rates, counts, time trends, aggregate comparisons, and time-boxed questions. Ask in plain English ("What\'s our offer acceptance rate last quarter?", "Where are candidates stuck in my reqs?", "How have rejection reasons drifted?"). ONE call resolves the scope (including "my reqs"), reads the complete scoped data, applies the time window server-side (this/last quarter, this year, last N days/weeks/months), and computes the answer with honest disclosures. Prefer this whenever the question wants a NUMBER or aggregate ANALYSIS. For individual resume, scorecard, note, or candidate-history comparisons, use the corresponding scoped evidence/read tools instead. A question outside the covered domains still gets an answer: the broad diagnostic panel runs and the result is LABELLED an approximation (mode approximate_composite, domain_recognized false) naming both what ran and the analyses to rephrase toward.',
