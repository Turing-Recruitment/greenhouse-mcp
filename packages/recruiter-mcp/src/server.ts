/**
 * Delivered to the client model at MCP initialize.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Several clients truncate server instructions at roughly 2,048 characters, so
 * everything a model must know to make a legal call has to land before that cut: the routing ladder,
 * then the read conventions. The near-neighbour routing table and this tenant's data caveats sit
 * after it — a model that never reads them still calls correctly, just less well targeted.
 *
 * These conventions used to be restated on every parameter that obeyed them: the date-range blurb on
 * 117 parameters, the pagination convention on 157, the scope-carrier convention on 71 — 83 KB of the
 * catalog saying the same three things (R2c). They are stated once, here, and the per-parameter text
 * points at them. test/catalog-budget.test.ts locks both the placement and the total.
