/**
 * R2c — the catalog is context every recruiter pays for on every call, so it is measured, not
 * assumed.
 *
 * MEASURED BASELINES (this harness: instructions + tools/list through a real McpServer and an
 * in-memory client, JSON.stringify of the tools array, UTF-8 bytes).
 *
 *   before R2  44 mounted tools   99,230 B tools +  4,003 B instructions = 103,233 B (~25.8k tokens)
 *   before R2  66 registered      148,917 B      +  4,003 B              = 152,920 B (~38.2k tokens)
 *   after R2a+R2b, 70 tools       159,961 B      +  4,003 B              = 163,964 B (~41.0k tokens)
 *   after R2c,     70 tools       120,918 B      +  5,046 B              = 125,964 B (~31.5k tokens)
 *   after R2d,     81 tools       139,220 B      +  5,046 B              = 144,266 B (~36.1k tokens)
 *
 * So the surface ends at 81 read tools — 37 more than a recruiter could reach before week two — for
 * 8,654 B LESS than the 66-tool catalog cost, and 20,743 B less than the 44 mounted tools plus the
 * 22 that were hidden. With a full write entitlement the 103-tool catalog is 182,821 B (~45.7k).
 *
 * Where the 66-tool baseline went (measured per parameter name, 619 params over 66 tools):
 *   created_at + updated_at   35,700 B   the anyOf date-range union on 117 params
 *   offset + per_page + cursor 32,490 B  one pagination convention, restated 157 times
 *   scope_handle + job_ids     14,980 B  one scope convention, restated 71 times
 * i.e. 51% of the catalog was JSON-Schema plumbing repeating three sentences. R2c states each once —
 * in SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS, which the client reads at initialize — and leaves the per-parameter text as
 * a pointer rather than a paragraph.

/**
 * The ceiling: no growth over the 66-tool catalog this repo already had, after R2b and R2d add
 * sixteen tools and R2c adds a description to every previously bare parameter.
